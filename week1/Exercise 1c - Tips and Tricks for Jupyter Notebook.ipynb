    "#### Part 2: The Menus\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of this page you might notice the notebook menu. Let's walk through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### File\n",
    "Here you can create a new Notebook, open existing ones and rename your notebook. One very usefull feature found here is Save and Checkpoint which lets you create checkpoint that you can roll back to when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Edit\n",
    "Here you can cut, copy, and paste cells. This is also where you would go if you wanted to delete, split, or merge a cell. You can reorder cells here too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some of the items in this menu are greyed out. The reason for this is that they do not apply to the currently selected cell. For example, a code cell cannot have an image inserted into it, but a Markdown cell can. If you see a greyed out menu item, try changing the cell’s type and see if the item becomes available to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### View\n",
    "The View menu is useful for toggling the visibility of the header and toolbar. You can also toggle Line Numbers within cells on or off. This is also where you would go if you want to mess about with the cell’s toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Insert\n",
    "The Insert menu is just for inserting cells above or below the currently selected cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cell\n",
    "This menu allows you to run one cell, a group of cells, or all the cells. You can also go here to change a cell’s type, although I personally find the toolbar to be more intuitive for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other handy feature in this menu is the ability to clear a cell’s output. If you are planning to share your Notebook with others, you will probably want to clear the output first so that the next person can run the cells themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Kernel \n",
    "The Kernel cell is for working with the kernel that is running in the background. Here you can restart the kernel, reconnect to it, shut it down, or even change which kernel your Notebook is using.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably won’t be working with the Kernel all that often, but there are times when you are debugging a Notebook that you will find you need to restart the Kernel. When that happens, this is where you would go.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Widgets\n",
    "The Widgets menu is for saving and clearing widget state. Widgets are basically JavaScript widgets that you can add to your cells to make dynamic content using Python (or another Kernel).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Help \n",
    "Finally you have the Help menu, here you can see all keyboard shortcuts, take a tour of the user interface as well as reference material."

The function `small_calculation` depends on the values `x` and `y`, however they aren't defined in the same cell which might seem odd. Let's assume that `x` and `y` take more than 10 minutes to calculate and return the same value each time, then we don't want to rerun those calculations each time we want to run `small_calculation`. Instead we can move them to another cell, run that cell once and use the same values over and over."
